# Hi, I'm Bryce (xSova) 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University, specializing in Software Development. Originally from Morro Bay, CA, and currently based in Omaha, NE, I blend the art of modern technology with the magic of spell writing.

By day, I'm a Software QA Engineer at [RTG Medical](https://rtgmedical.com/). By night, I'm a modern-day wizard, crafting spells (a.k.a. code) and compiling my library of repositories with magical incantations that breathe life into machines.

## 🎮 Interests

- 🎵 Making and listening to music
- 🕹️ Playing video games
- 📚 Accumulating (and sometimes completing) online courses
- ✨ Writing spells (coding) and expanding my grimoire (repositories)
- 🔮 [Pondering the orb](https://orbsimulator.glitch.me).

*P.S. As a budding spellwriter in the digital realm, I'm always eager to connect with fellow wizards, witches, and no-majs alike. Let's cast some spells together!*
