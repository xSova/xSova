# Hi, I'm Bryce (xSova) 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University, specializing in Software Development. Hailing from Morro Bay, CA, and currently based in Omaha, NE, I blend the art of modern technology with the mystique of spell writing.

By day, I'm a Software QA Engineer at [RTG Medical](https://rtgmedical.com/). By night, I'm a modern-day wizard, crafting spells (a.k.a. code) and compiling my grimoire of repositories with magical incantations that breathe life into machines.

## 🧙‍♂️ The Art of Spell Writing

In the realm of coding, I view each line of code as a spell, meticulously woven to create digital magic. My grimoire (repositories) is an ever-growing collection of these spells, ready to solve problems and create wonders with a flick of electricity. As a student of the arcane, I tend to gravitate toward:

- **Abjuration**: Crafting meticulous test suites, plans, and cases to safeguard software integrity.
- **Alchemy**: Experimenting with new technologies and frameworks to create innovative solutions, akin to the art of transmutation.
- **Divination**: Harnessing the power of data parsing and decision-making spells to uncover hidden insights.
- **Enchantment**: Breathing life into mundane tasks by conjuring reusable automations, akin to the whimsical mops from Fantasia.
- **Evocation**: Conjuring innovative wonders through spells that generate novel creations, such as generative visual or audio art.
- **Illusion**: Creating captivating user interfaces and experiences that deceive the eye with visual magic, making digital worlds come to life.
- **Transmutation**: Transforming data and structures into different forms or formats, like an alchemical transformation.

These magical disciplines are the threads that weave together my ever-expanding grimoire of repositories. Explore their incantations and join me on a journey through the enchanted realms of code. 🪄🌟
